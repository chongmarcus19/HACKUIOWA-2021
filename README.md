# ABROAD
## Inspiration
Through research and experience, it is well documented that international students tend to have trouble making friends with local students due to language barriers and cultural differences. For this reason, I believed that easily connected local students and international students would help.
## What it does
Each user will create an account in which they will select 5 interests or hobbies. They will then be taken to a page where they will be introduced with a list of users who have common interests with them. They will then have the option to contact them.
## How we built it
I used a combination of html, css, js, and postgresql to create the website. I then used docker in order to create a local host which could serve as a medium for my website to be hosted on.
## Challenges we ran into
Time constraints and issues pertaining to displaying the users properly on the home page were some of the bigger challenges. In addition, I worked by myself as I felt like I could learn more in my first hackathon and it was a bit more difficult for me to find a group as the event was held online.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I thought the site turned out aesthetically appealing, however, it could have been much better.
## What we learned
I got to implement a lot of new skills I learned this semester in my classes and I also learned how to apply my code to real-life situations as the assignments in classes can sometimes feel unfulfilling as there is no real implication to them.
## What's next for Abroad
By creating these friendships between international and local students, it gives local students an easy way to learn from people of other cultures while international students can learn from their local friends which allows them more easily transition from one culture to another. I would have liked to implement a direct messaging system. However, with the 24-hour time limit, I could not figure it out in the time frame, as the implementation for one was complicated.
